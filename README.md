# schemer-desktop
The electron app for turning your database schema into an ER diagram

# Short-term Goals

The goals of the project in the near future are to:

- [x] Provide an easy to use UI for making a connection to a MySQL database
- [x] Read in the schema information & use it to populate "entity" components
- [ ] Have an additional SVG layer that can go on top of or behind `<the-grid>`.  This will be used to draw the arrows representing relationships between entities
